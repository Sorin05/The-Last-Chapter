## Introduction
The Last Chapter is an book retailer best known for selling books, stationery, cards, gifts. I used an double entendre as this would be my "Last Chapter" with Code Institute 
The inspiration of the website came from my visit to Bucharest Romania and saw an old man selling old books on the sidewalk of a main street, I stoped and had a browse and I was impressed by the huge selection of old books, I tought that he could have a cool website for old vintage books. 
Unfornutely I cannot finish this project on time so my first submision is of a incomplete project that im still working on . The whole project is based on Code Institute Boutique Ado with the intent of adding my own apps and features making it an online bookstore and office supplies. 
My second attempt to finish the project for the deadline is a semi-failure in my opinion 
Note:


## UX

  ## Deployment

  Local Deployment

  Running locally
* Log in to GitHub and locate the Repository for this site.
* Under the repository name, above the list of files, click "Code".
* Here you can either Clone or Download the repository.
* You should clone the repository using HTTPS, clicking on the icon to copy the link.
* Open Git Bash.
* Change the current working directory to the new location, where you want the cloned directory to be.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL that was copied in Step 4.
* Press Enter, and your local clone will be created.
* You will also need to install all of the project requirements. This can be done using the command pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
* Type python3 app.py in your GitPod terminal to run your local site of this project.

  #### Deploy to Heroku

    Deployment
The website of this project requires back-end technologies such as server, application, and database so the website is deployed on Heroku, which is a cloud platform with a service supporting several programming languages, because GitHub can only host a static websites.
Before deploying the website to Heroku, there are three important steps to follow to make the application work in Heroku correctly.
* Create requirements.txt file that contains the names of packages being used in Python. It is important to update the file if other packages or modules are installed during the project.
* Create Procfile that contains the name of the application file so that Heroku knows what to run.
* Push them into GitHub.
* Once above steps have been followed the website can be deployed. Please find the steps of the deployment in Heroku:
* Create an account in Heroku
* Click New & Create new app to create a new app
* Put an app name, which must be unique, choose a region and click create app
* Go to Deploy section and click Connect to GithHub
* Search for the repository by the repository name and connect it
* Before clicking Enable Automatic Deploys, hidden variables such as IP address, PORT, SECRET_KEY need to be recorded in Heroku. Go to Settings, click 'Reveal config vars' and fill out necessary keys and values.
* Once all the hidden variables are recorded, then click Enable Automatic Deploys and click Deploy Branch (Main should be selected unless you want other branches to be deployed).
* When the app is deployed by Heroku correctly, there is a confirmation message and you can access the app.
